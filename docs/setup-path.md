# Add hyprkan to your PATH

For simpler use, move the script to a directory in your PATH to run hyprkan from anywhere.

```bash
mv hyprkan.py ~/.local/bin/hyprkan
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/hyprkan
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that directory exists in your PATH environment variable (in your bash, zsh, or other shell config) so the command can be run globally.
